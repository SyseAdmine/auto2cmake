# auto2cmake
Convert an autotools project to CMake.

I'm dealing with it as a private learning project
to better understand CMake and Python.

A maybe unreachable goal (for my small abibilities) is
to convert the LibreOffice build system from
autotools/gbuild to Cmake and/or Meson,
using the upcoming Common Package Specification:

Don't feel hesitate to give me hints to improve the script
or make pull requests, also on upstream:
